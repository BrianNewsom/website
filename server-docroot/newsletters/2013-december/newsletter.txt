*** PhET is Busy Working on Two Big Initiatives:

We are excited to have completed the design phase for the "Teach with PhET" website! Thanks to Theresa Niel Strategy and
Design for their excellent work and to all the teachers who participated in the planning and review stages of this project.

The "Teach with PhET" website is designed just for educators like you, providing quick and easy access to the resources,
support, and community you need to get started with, or extend, your use of PhET in the classroom! You will be able to:
- Easily find relevant simulations and activities
- Access research-based strategies, video guides, and exemplars for teaching with PhET
- See teacher recommendations and read reviews
- Bookmark, tag and organize your resources in "My PhET"
- Share ideas and learn from other teachers
- And more ...

Browse the designs at: http://phet.colorado.edu/teachwithphet. We hope you are as excited as we are about this new site.
Send any suggestions to phethelp@colorado.edu, and spread the word about our crowdfunding campaign! We want to turn this
vision into a reality: http://www.crowdrise.com/helpbuildteachwithphet

*** New Next-Generation PhET Simulations Now Available!

Have you been following our progress on creating next-generation PhET sims? These new simulations update our designs to
work with touch or mouse interaction, and they are built on a new HTML5 code base, meaning that they run seamlessly on
all of todayâ€™s classroom technologies from PCs, to tablets (iPads or Android-based), to Chromebooks. Hats off to our
amazing software development team for their work to push the boundaries of HTML5 technology!

To access the new sims, visit http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/category/html.
