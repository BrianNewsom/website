*** Be One of the First to Experience our Sims on Tablets

Are you an iPad or Android tablet user? You'll be happy to hear that we've been busy working on a pathway to
make our more popular sims tablet compatible. We've been prototyping sims and testing out various HTML5
libraries with advice from Google and other HTML5 developers.

If you would like to take a quick peek at our progress, try the HTML5 prototypes:

    * Masses & Springs (http://phet.colorado.edu/files/prototypes-2012/masses-and-springs/simulations/masses-and-springs/)
    * Energy Skate Park (http://phet.colorado.edu/files/prototypes-2012/energy-skate-park/simulations/energy-skate-park/)
    * Build an Atom (http://phet.colorado.edu/files/prototypes-2012/build-an-atom/simulations/build-an-atom/)
    * Concentration (http://phet.colorado.edu/files/prototypes-2012/concentration/simulations/concentration/)
    * Faraday's Electromagnetic Lab (http://phet.colorado.edu/files/prototypes-2012/faraday/simulations/faraday/)

Please keep in mind that these sims are prototypes. Many lack the complete physics models, array of
features, and polished look-and-feel of our published sims on our website, but we wanted to give you a
sense of our progress so far.

Keeping up with technology change is a resource-intensive challenge. You can help support the conversion
of the sims to tablet compatibility by donating today!

*** Featured Sims:

Forces and Motion: Basics (http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/forces-and-motion-basics)

The latest addition to our simulations designed specifically for middle school science! Explore the forces 
at work in a tug of war or pushing a refrigerator, crate, or person. Create an applied force and see how it
makes objects move. Change friction and see how it affects the motion of objects.

After the activity, students will be able to:
    * Identify when forces are balanced vs unbalanced.
    * Determine the sum of forces (net force) on an object with more than one force on it.
    * Predict the motion of an object with zero net force.
    * Predict the direction of motion given a combination of forces.
