*** Featured Sims:

Explore Snell's Law and More with Bending Light

Investigate the bending of light (refraction) between two mediums with different refractive indices
with the new Bending Light sim (http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/bending-light). See how
changing from air to water to glass changes the bending angle. Play with prisms of different shapes
and make rainbows. Use more tools to measure light intensity and probe E-field versus time. Students
can learn what determines the angle of refraction, how to apply Snell's law, how the speed and
wavelength of light changes in different materials, and how wavelength effects the angle of
refraction. In the end, students will be able to explain how a prism creates a rainbow.

Increase Engagement with Balancing Chemical Equations

Make learning how to balance a chemical equation more fun with the new Balancing Chemical Equations
sim (http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/balancing-chemical-equations). What can you change to
balance an equation? Play a game to test your ideas!

After the activity, students will be able to:
        * Balance a chemical equation.
        * Explain that the number of atoms of each element is conserved in a chemical reaction.
        * Describe the difference between coefficients and subscripts in a chemical equation.
        * Translate from symbolic to molecular representations of matter.

*** Meet Kelly:

What got you involved in PhET?
I had some teaching experience, but I was eager to learn more about how students learn chemistry.
PhET gave me an opportunity to grow as an educator. What I did not expect was how much chemistry I
would learn in the process!

What do you do for PhET?
I work with the team to design and develop new chemistry sims, and I help run workshops for teachers.
I also study the effect of PhET on student learning in interview and classroom settings, and present
the research at conferences and in papers.

How do you see PhET helping teachers?
I like how the open-source nature of PhET gives science teachers who have little access to lab
equipment -- or even the internet -- a way to use inquiry in their classrooms. I am excited to use
the sims in my own teaching!

How do you see PhET helping kids?
I am continually amazed at how much students learn from using the sims, and how PhET engages students
in learning science. PhET gets students to ask their own questions, which is what science is all about!

Where do you see PhET going?
I think PhET will grow in two areas: the earth and life sciences, and the middle school level. Our
new sim-sharing project will give teachers more ways to use PhET in their classrooms. And of course,
stay tuned for more chemistry sims!
