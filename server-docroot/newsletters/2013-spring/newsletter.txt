*** PhET's End-of-School Campaign

Over the summer PhET will be hard at work upgrading our simulations for the new school year. Help
support our summer vacation work and give the gift of learning by donating today!

*** PhET is Busy Working on Two Big Initiatives:

* Big Initiative #1: Designing a new "Teach with PhET" Website

Our new "Teach with PhET" companion website is being designed for you - teachers and other education
professionals who are using or want to use PhET simulations in your work. With the new site, you will
be able to easily find the simulations or activities relevant for your courses and to readily access
a new suite of resources with ideas and strategies for classroom implementation based on our research.
The website plan includes 1) research-based implementation strategies, including exemplar annotated
activities and video clips from K12 and college classrooms, 2) professional videos introducing
teachers to PhET, 3) course integration guidance and searchable K12 standards, 4) improved sharing
and searching of simulations and teacher-contributed activities, 5) community forums, and 6) a
"My PhET" feature where you can create custom collections of simulations and activities.

  Featured Video: Using PhET in Lecture: Going Beyond Demos?

Have you seen our latest video "Using PhET in Lecture: Going Beyond Demos" which is the first of
many videos that will be available on the new site? See how to use PhET simulations in powerful ways
that engage a whole class in a large lecture setting. See examples of how you can incorporate
simulations with clickers and other instructional techniques to deliver engaging interactive lecture
demonstrations that will make maximum impact on student learning.

* Big Initiative #2: Creating Next Generation PhET Simulations

Look for a handful of next-generation simulations to be available by the end of this summer,
including HTML5 versions of Concentration, John Travoltage, and Forces and Motion: Basics. These
next-generation simulations will not only be touch and tablet optimized but will also eventually
include additional improvements such as enhanced data input-output capabilities to support 3rd party
customization. Because all our next-generation simulations will be HTML5, they will run seamlessly
on all of today's classroom technologies from PCs, to tablets (iPads or Android-based), to Chromebooks.

*** Featured New Sim:

Graphing Lines (http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/graphing-lines)

We're excited to add another simulation to our growing mathematics collection. With the new
Graphing Lines simulation, explore the world of lines. Investigate the relationships between linear
equations, slope, and graphs of lines. Challenge yourself in the line game!

After the activity, students will be able to:
    * Explain how the slope of a graphed line can be computed.
    * Graph a line given an equation in either slope-intercept or point-slope form.
    * Write an equation in slope-intercept or point-slope form given a graphed line.
    * Predict how changing variables in a linear equation will affect the graphed line.
