Fall 2014 Newsletter - PhET Interactive Simulations (http://phet.colorado.edu)

*** Find More Resources at the New "For Teachers" Page (http://phet.colorado.edu/en/for-teachers)

Looking for resources to help you use PhET in your classroom?
Want to watch seasoned instructors using PhET and hear their ideas?

We are excited to launch an updated "For Teachers" section, including videos, downloadable tip sheets,
and course alignment guides for K12 and college instructors.

Find resources on:
    Planning to Use PhET (http://phet.colorado.edu/en/for-teachers/planningToUsePhet)
    Using PhET in Lecture: An Overview (http://phet.colorado.edu/en/for-teachers/usingPhetInLecture)
    Interactive Lecture Demonstrations (http://phet.colorado.edu/en/for-teachers/lectureDemo)

*** Featured HTML5 Simulation: Balancing Chemical Equations (http://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/balancing-chemical-equations/latest/balancing-chemical-equations_en.html)

We're excited about the new HTML5 Balancing Chemical Equations -with new layout and design updates that support
touch-screen environments. Explore and discover how you know if a chemical equation is balanced. Then, play a game to
test your ideas!

Students learn to:
    Balance a chemical equation.
    Recognize that the number of atoms of each element is conserved in a chemical reaction.
    Describe the difference between coefficients and subscripts in a chemical equation.
    Translate from symbolic to molecular representations of matter.

    Thanks to the new American Association of Chemistry Teachers organization for their generous donation to help bring
    this simulation to HTML5.

*** And, Just For Software Developers

Our educational HTML5 libraries are open source and ready to use for your development projects. We've created a new guide
to help you start developing with PhET libraries at http://bit.ly/phet-development-overview along with a getting-started
video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8Jw2Qx-1gE

Learn how to:
    Check out the PhET HTML5 libraries and simulations from GitHub
    Create new simulations
    Understand & customize code for our simulations
    Submit bug fixes for our simulations
    Embed a PhET simulation in your own website
    Use powerful libraries for rendering, audio, touch/mouse/pen input, geometry, MVC, UI and more.
    Communicate with PhET developers and others developing with PhET libraries
