*** Meet Our Founder and Nobel Laureate, Carl Wieman:

What was the inspiration behind PhET?
 The beginning of PhET really goes back to around 1990. I was working with Professor Marty Goldman
 on a project called Physics 2000 where I got introduced to the idea of online interactive simulations.
 At that point I was developing them to explain my research in laser cooling and Bose-Einstein
 condensation. But as I gave talks on this all over the world in different settings, I discovered
 the simulations were really quite amazing compared to other teaching tools, in that they seemed
 to work very well and were very engaging. People learned a lot from them whether they were physics
 professors at a colloquium or middle school students. So I kept thinking about how to incorporate
 them into teaching more widely, and then I won an NSF Distinguished Teaching award. I used some of
 the money to get some sims started, and very soon after, I won the Nobel Prize. And so for us, my
 wife and me, it seemed like a natural thing to donate part of this big pot of money that came out
 of the sky to really get this project started. I used some of the money from the Nobel prize to
 hire the teams of people that were really necessary to develop and test sophisticated interactive
 simulations. And, I was lucky enough to get very good people and things just took off from there.
 For us, it has been very rewarding to see how successful this investment has been.

In your opinion, what makes PhET sims special?
 Using the sims as a teacher, which I've done a lot myself, one thing that makes them special is that
 they get the students really engaged. The students follow the sims, they're interested in it, they
 want to explore with it. But it also brings in real-world experiences and connects up what they know
 from the outside world with the kind of book-learning we're trying to achieve. I think that it's very
 important in science not just to produce more scientists, although that's clearly important, but also
 to allow everybody to understand science better and to understand the role it plays in our lives. The
 sims bridge this gap in a way no other educational materials can. They strip out a lot of the technical
 jargon and the mathematics and therefore make the basic science much more accessible and understandable.
 The students develop their own mental models of physical phenomena. That's a much deeper, more useful
 level of understanding than memorizing procedures and facts, which is a lot of what people get in
 classes, but is really not real expertise in the subject. Another very nice feature is they really
 invite students to engage in scientific thinking themselves. By interacting with the sims, the students
 test things, make predictions, develop models so they see what science really is all about. With the
 sims, the invisible becomes visible, and they can see what atoms and light are doing. This process of
 discovering really helps them identify as scientists. They can see how "I can discover things and
 understand things." Suddenly, larger groups of people who would never have experienced this before
 (including in particular groups very underrepresented in science) can start thinking of themselves,
 essentially, as potential scientists.

So what makes the sims so effective in reaching students?
 There's all kind of efforts to bring technology into education. But, what we've strived for, and I
 think what makes PhET unique, is the fact that it's based on looking very carefully at what we know
 about learning, how the human brain learns, and builds into the technology the activities that achieve
 that. That's done by having very good software engineers work with excellent scientists who know the
 materials and educational researchers who understand how people learn. They do a very careful iterative
 process of testing how effectively these work, refining them, changing them, and improving them until
 we have something that we can really be quite confident achieves the desired interaction and learning.
 I think if you look at the most educational technology, it really has not gone through this sort of
 developmental process, and it's not building on research on learning.

Where do you think PhET can improve?
 PhET has made great strides, but I see there's still a great deal to be done, and a great many future
 opportunities. Every time I turn around I notice something, whether it's biology or paleontology,
 where I think, "Gee, a PhET simulation would really help teach this!" And of course that applies down
 into grade school and up into graduate school. So there are enormous opportunities. But one of the
 things we need to work on is more research showing their effectiveness. The research so far has been
 really dominated by our own group, and I think there are tremendous opportunities to do more research
 on understanding both how to optimize what students are learning and how they're best learning from
 PhET sims. From that work, we can really understand how to use educational technology in more effective
 ways than people are doing right now. Also, another area where I see we need to improve is providing
 more support and guidance to teachers on how to use these powerful simulations in the most educationally
 effective ways. Because this is a new technology, teachers are not familiar with them. We need to support
 them with more professional development so they can take full advantage of the capability and power of
 an interactive simulation for education.

Reflecting on the past 10 years, has the project met your hopes and expectations?
 When I first started PhET, I didn't really have nearly the grand vision it's turned into. I just saw
 lots of opportunities to use the sims in classes I was teaching and other people were teaching. I thought,
 "This would make it a lot easier to understand material and make it a lot more interesting. Simulations
 could do a better job of showing students how physics relates to the real world around them." And it was
 only as we developed more and more sims and we saw the use growing throughout the world that I began to
 see the broader potential for PhET impacting education. What really surprised me was the international
 span of it, how they are being translated into so many languages and being used by many tens of millions
 of students all across the world.

What are some of the challenges facing PhET?
 One of the ongoing challenges for the PhET project is that it's expensive to develop such a high-quality
 product and keep it continually upgraded and up to date. For example, technology is changing all the time.
 There are new platforms, new hardware, new software. That puts great demands on a project like PhET to
 keep at the cutting edge, to keep upgrading, to keep branching out so it can be used on tablets or the
 next thing that's going to come after that. That's just part of the price of working with technology that
 one has to do, but it has a significant price that one has to face. We're hoping that people will see
 how they can help support PhET as we did, to build it to enhance science education.

*** Featured Sims:

Plate Tectonics (http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/plate-tectonics)

We are excited to offer the latest earth science simulation: Plate Tectonics. Explore how plates move on
the surface of the earth. Change temperature, composition, and thickness of plates. Discover how to
create new mountains, volcanoes, or oceans!

After the activity, students will be able to:
    * Describe the differences between oceanic and continental crust
    * Predict how changes in composition and temperature change crust density and buoyancy
    * Draw a time series for different types of plate boundaries and their motions
    * Deduce the type of plate boundary given images or descriptions of surface features.
    * Explain which types of plate boundaries create crust, and which destroy crust


Fractions Intro (http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/fractions-intro)

Explore Fractions Intro while you help yourself to 1/3 of a chocolate cake and wash it down with 1/2 a
glass of orange juice! Create your own fractions using fun interactive objects. Match shapes and numbers
to earn stars in the fractions games. Challenge yourself on any level you like. Try to collect lots of
stars!

Learning goals include:
    * Predict and explain how changing the numerator or denominator of a fraction affects the fraction's value
    * Convert between a picture of a fraction, a numeric fraction, and a point on a number line
    * Find matching fractions using numbers and pictures
    * Make equivalent fractions using different numbers
    * Compare fractions using numbers and patterns
