Choose a PhET crowdfunding project &amp; join PhET's village of supporters</title>

Please join PhET this #GivingTuesday and give the gift of science and math to millions of children around the world.

It takes a village to build quality open (free) education resources. And that's what PhET Interactive Simulations at
University of Colorado Boulder (http://phet.colorado.edu) has been doing since 2002. We work hard to make science and
math fun and exciting -- and accessible for everyone.

But we need your help! If you're an educator, parent, student, STEM supporter or a company, please consider giving to
one of our new crowdfunding campaigns. Any amount helps - minimum donation is $10.

Choose one or support both!

--- Build the "Teach with PhET" website:
Help us build the "Teach with PhET" website that will support teachers in your neighborhood and around the world...making
it easier to use PhET sims.
- Goal: $500,000 (or ~20,000 people giving ~$25 each).

--- Bring Circuit Construction Kit to the iPad:

Circuit Construction Kit DC. Your support will move this simulation to iPad and tablet compatibility using the latest
HTML5 software technology.
