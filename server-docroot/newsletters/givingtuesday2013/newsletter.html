<p>
    Please join PhET this <strong>#GivingTuesday</strong> and give the gift of science and math to millions of children around the world.
    </p>

<p>
It takes a village to build quality open (free) education resources. And that's what PhET Interactive Simulations at University of Colorado Boulder (<a href="http://phet.colorado.edu">http://phet.colorado.edu</a>) has been doing since 2002. We work hard to make science and math fun and exciting -- and accessible for everyone.
</p>
<p>
But we need your help! If you're an educator, parent, student, STEM supporter or a company, please consider giving to one of our new crowdfunding campaigns. Any amount helps - minimum donation is $10.
