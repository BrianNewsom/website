                                    background on environmental problems, specifically atmospheric science. For my graduate degree, I
                                    studied ozone depletion and creating new instruments that would help measure chemical compounds
                                    important in controlling ozone in the atmosphere.

                                    Then I came to Colorado to focus on tropospheric chemistry. (The troposphere is where we all live.) But
                                    I felt a longing to work on a project that had more immediate impact on people and their lives. The
                                    university was advertising for a position of physics instructor who would also work in physics education
                                    research. That was the first time I'd ever heard of this new - and still growing - field. It was
                                    exciting and eye-opening for me to think that you could study how people learn science and take those
                                    results and teach science more effectively. In 2003, I began working as a postdoctoral researcher with
                                    Carl Wieman, working on the PhET project as well as co-teaching courses for non-science majors. Together
                                    we would examine the course content and how it should be taught, and create an interactive lecture
                                    experience using clickers and simulations. The idea was to tie the content to everyday life, improve
                                    learning and make science relevant and interesting for students.

                                    <p style="font-weight:bold;">What are the main goals of PhET?</p>
                                    PhET's mission is to advance science literacy and education worldwide through engaging, interactive
                                    simulations. Each simulation offers an intuitive, game-like environment where students can engage in
                                    exploration like a scientist would, and where they can see the invisible, so they can literally interact
                                    with things like electrons, neutrons and protons to build their own atoms. Through the interaction and
                                    the immediate feedback they get, they can develop an understanding of key science concepts such as
                                    important cause-and-effect relationships and can build connections to everyday life. They can also
                                    experiment with things they can't experiment with in everyday life, such as building molecules, changing
                                    gravity, or shooting photons. With the Circuit Construction Kit simulation, for instance, students can
                                    interact with a battery by easily increasing or decreasing the voltage with a slider and immediately see
                                    how a light bulb gets brighter and electrons go faster when they increase the voltage. With the
                                    simulations, students can develop a visual, mental model of what's happening.

                            <p style="font-weight:bold;">What makes PhET different from other simulations?</p>
                            One thing that makes the PhET project unique is that it's research-based. We take the published research and our
                            own research, digest it, and integrate it into the design. Our group studies the features of effective
                            simulations, how students learn from simulations, and use of simulations in the classroom. Right now, we have
                            about 15 people on the PhET team. It's a great team. Everyone is vested in making the best simulations possible,
                            simulations that are highly effective learning tools and are also fun for students. When we start a new
                            simulation, we create a design team with expertise across different areas. The team will have content
                            specialists, teachers who would use the simulation, design experts, an education researcher and professional
                            software developer. We brainstorm about the simulation. We storyboard the design and develop scenarios of what
                            students would be able to interact with. Once that's done, we start programming and test features as we go
                            along. For every simulation, we conduct interviews with students. During the "think-aloud" interview, we ask
                            them to open and play with everything and talk about what they are doing. We want to see whether students engage
                            with learning from the simulation and find out what is working and what is not. We always learn something, and
                            make revisions as necessary. It takes about four to nine months to complete a simulation.
                        </p>

                            <p style="font-weight:bold;">Where does PhET funding come from?</p>
                            Most of the funding comes from federal grants and foundations. We want the PhET project to be sustainable for
                            the long-term, however, so we're trying to increase the number of corporate and individual donations. Companies
                            are allowed to use the simulations for free. Pearson, for instance, uses them in textbooks and in their online
                            homework system. We're working to develop an NPR-like model where companies sponsor the project in lieu of a
                            licensing fee, so that we can create more simulations and improve the sustainability of the project. We are also
                            trying to develop a micro-donation model so that individuals can donate small amounts. Every year, 22 million
                            simulations are run from our website and in 5 years we expect this number to be more than 100 million.
                            Eventually, micro-donations could help fund a significant fraction of the budget.
