        <h1 style="color: #d36a04;">CU's PhET Interactive Simulations project selected as a Tech Award Laureate - 9/15/11</h1>

        <p>
            We are honored to have been selected as a 2011 Tech Award Laureate. <a href="http://www.techawards.org">The Tech Awards</a>,
            a signature program of <a href="http://www.thetech.org">The Tech Museum</a>, and
            presented by Applied Materials, Inc., selected PhET from among hundreds of nominations representing 54 countries. The Tech
            Awards: Technology Benefiting Humanity is one of the premier annual humanitarian awards programs in the world, recognizing
            technical solutions that benefit humanity and address the most critical issues facing our planet and its people.
        </p>

        <p>
            For those new to PhET and our work to advance science literacy and education worldwide, we include a brief introduction to the
            project below as well as links to photos of PhET being used around the world, to our Tech Award application, and to an amazing
            nomination letter from PhET user Sandor Nagy from Hungary.

                        For teachers and students around the world, the PhET project provides interactive simulations that are based on
                        extensive education research and support more effective science education. Going beyond traditional educational
                        resources, PhET simulations offer an intuitive, game-like environment where students can learn through
                        scientist-like exploration, where dynamic visual representations make the invisible visible, and where science ideas
                        are connected to real-world phenomena. Unlike most educational software, PhET simulations are free, easily
                        translated into local languages, and available either online or offline, especially important for areas with poor or
                        no internet connectivity. With their flexible design, the simulations can be used in many ways - as demos,
                        homeworks, or inexpensive, yet accurate and realistic, lab alternatives.

                        Teachers and students around the world are using PhET simulations, from grade school to university and in more than
                        60 languages. Some specifics:
