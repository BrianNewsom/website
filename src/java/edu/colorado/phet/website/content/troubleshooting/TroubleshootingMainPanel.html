                comes with most computers while Java Web Start is a free application that can be downloaded from Sun

        </h3>
        <div wicket:id="troubleshooting-main-q8-answer">
            <p>On some laptop computers, simulations may appear to run much slower than anticipated and/or exhibit
                unexpected
                graphics problems. This may be due to power management settings that affect how the computer's graphics
                system
                runs and can be corrected by either a) changing the computer's power management configuration, or b)
                using the
                laptop computer while plugged in to an AC power source.</p>

            <p>Many laptop computers are configured to reduce the amount of battery power used by the graphics/video
                system
                while the computer is running on battery power. If you must use the laptop while it is not plugged in,
                we
                suggest changing your computer's power management settings to "maximize performance" while unplugged.
                This
                should ensure that the graphics system runs at its peak speed. The location of this setting varies from
                one
                manufacturer to the next and we suggest contacting your computer vendor if you have difficulty locating
                it.

                version of the PhET website on your computer. When you access this locally installed copy, your computer
                will
                use your default browser, which for many people is Internet Explorer. If the security settings are set
                to their
                default values, you may get an error that says <em>"To help protect your security, Internet Explorer has
                    restricted this webpage from running scripts or ActiveX controls that could access your computer.
                    Click here
                    for options..."</em> (or something similar). This is a security feature of Internet Explorer version
                6 and
                later, and is meant to warn users about running active content locally. The PhET simulations present no
                danger
                to your computer, and running them locally is no different than running them from the web site.
            </p>

            <p>If you wish to disable this warning, you can do so by adjusting your browser's security settings. For IE
                versions
                6 and 7, the way to do this is to go into Tools->Internet Options->Advanced, find the "Security"
                heading, and
                check "Allow active content to run in files on My Computer". Note that you will need to restart Internet
                Explorer to get this change to take effect. You should only do this if feel confident that there is no
                other
                off-line content that you may run on your computer that could be malicious.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, you could use a different browser (such as Firefox) that does not have this issue.

            <p>The PhET simulations that are distributed with the installer include a "digital certificate" that
                verifies that
                these simulations were actually created by PhET. This is a security measure that helps to prevent an
                unscrupulous individual from creating applications that claim to be produced by PhET but are not. If the
                certificate acceptance dialog says that the publisher is "PhET, University of Colorado", and the dialog
                also
                says that the signature was validated by a trusted source, you can have a high degree of confidence that
                the
                application was produced by the PhET team.</p>

            <p>On most systems, it is possible to permanently accept the PhET certificate and thereby prevent this
                dialog from
                appearing each time a simulation is run locally. Most Windows and Max OSX systems have a check box on
                the
                certificate acceptance dialog that says "Always trust content from this publisher". Checking this box
                will
                configure your system in such a way that the dialog will no longer appear when starting up PhET
                simulations.</p>

                When a Java Web Start simulation is run in Windows, it is added to the list of programs in Control Panel

            <p>If a simulation that uses 3D graphics is not launching or displaying correctly, updating your video card's drivers may fix the

            <p>For Windows XP / Vista / 7:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Press the Win + R keys.</li>
                <li>ype "DxDiag" and press enter.</li>
                <li>After the diagnostic tool opens, the video card name and manufacturer will be listed in the Display tab under Device.</li>
                <li>Go to the driver manufacturer's website to find an up-to-date driver. The most common video card manufacturers are <a
