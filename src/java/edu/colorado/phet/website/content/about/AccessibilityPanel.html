        <h2>Sonification Prototypes</h2>

        <p>Below are links to prototypes of PhET simulations that include sonification, i.e. the use of non-speech sounds to
            convey meaning. These prototypes are part of an ongoing research and development project to incorporate
            sonification into PhET simulations. The goal of this work is to increase the accessibility of the simulations and
            to explore how multimodal features (such as the addition of sound) can support student engagement. These prototypes
            are part our early experimentation with sonification.</p>

        <p>Note: As of February 2015, these prototypes have only been tested in the Chrome browser.</p>
