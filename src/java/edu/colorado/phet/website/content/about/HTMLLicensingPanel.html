                <p>The University of Colorado and the PhET Interactive Simulations Project support the protection of individual privacy, and ensuring
                    the confidentiality of information provided by its employees, students, visitors, and resource users.</p>

                <p id="agreement-IV-B" class="bold indent">B. <u>Information Collected</u></p>

                <p>It is the policy and practice of the University to collect the least amount of personally identifiable information necessary to
                    fulfill its required duties and responsibilities, complete a particular transaction, deliver services, or as required by law. This
                    applies to the collection of all personally identifiable information regardless of source or medium.</p>

                <p>Users may choose whether or not to provide personally identifiable information to the University and PhET via the PhET website.</p>

                <p>In order to document the amount of use of PhET simulations and to provide the best services to our users, PhET collects
                    non-personally identifying information through the use of Google Analytics in each PhET Regular HTML Simulation File. When the
                    simulation is opened, information is collected via Google Analytics' standard web statistics services. As of July 8, 2014 Google
                    Analytics Terms of Service are located here <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</a>.

                <p>The PhET has in place appropriate security measures to protect against the unauthorized use or access of its data. Such measures
                    include internal review of data collection, storage, and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security
                    measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where data is stored.</p>

                <p id="agreement-IV-D" class="bold indent">D. <u>Information Sharing</u></p>

                <p>Access to information collected through the use of PhET simulations is limited to those employees, contractors, and agents who need
                    to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our services. PhET may report a summary of this information (in
                    aggregate) to other organizations and individuals for grant reporting purposes, or in published articles to document PhET's
                    wide-spread use. No personally-identifying information is distributed. PhET requires third parties to whom it discloses
                    information to protect the information in accordance with this policy and applicable law. In addition, PhET may disclose
                    information to third parties when such disclosure is required or permitted by law.</p>
