      <h2>I. OVERVIEW</h2>

      <p>This PhET Software Agreement ("<b>Agreement</b>") pertains to the collection of HTML simulations developed by the PhET Interactive
        Simulations Project at the University of Colorado Boulder ("<b>PhET</b>"). PhET currently offers three different software
        licensing options, which are detailed in Section II(A), II(B) and II(C) below, to the users of its HTML simulations.</p>

      <p>This Agreement and the licenses specified below do <i>not</i> permit the licensing of PhET's Java or Flash simulations. Information
        regarding PhET's Java or Flash simulations is available at <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu">http://phet.colorado.edu</a>.</p>

      <p>In order to document the amount of use of PhET simulations and to provide the best services to our users, PhET collects
        non-personally identifying information through the use of Google Analytics in each PhET Regular HTML Simulation File. When the
        simulation is opened, information is collected via Google Analytics' standard web statistics services. As of July 8, 2014 Google
        Analytics Terms of Service are located here <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html</a>.
