        <h1>The Future of PhET</h1>

        <div style="position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0; color: #aaa;">August 15, 2013</div>

        <p>
            The PhET Interactive Simulations project at University of Colorado Boulder has developed a vision for next-generation PhET sims. This
            vision leverages new technologies to extend access to PhET simulations across platforms, to increase customization options, to enhance
            data sharing capabilities, and to support integration with diverse educational products.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, we are excited and proud to announce the first-steps towards realizing our vision for next-generation PhET sims. Over the past
            year, our software development team pushed the boundaries of HTML5 to enable our new sims to run in any modern web browser, including on
            tablets such as the iPad.
        </p>

        <h2>Optimized for today's educational platforms</h2>

        <p>
            Since we primarily support students and teachers in educational environments, we have optimized our next-generation sims for the most
            common platforms. Our new sim designs work well with either mouse or touch interactions, and sim performance is optimized for the
            following systems:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>Windows XP and Windows 7 PCs</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browsers: Internet Explorer 9 and up, and the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><em>Mac OS 10.6+ PCs</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browsers: Safari 6 and up, and the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><em>iPad and iPad Mini with iOS 6 and up</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browsers: latest version of Safari</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><em>Chromebook with Chrome OS</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Browsers: latest version of Chrome</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            *Note, although our HTML5 sims run well on many Android tablets and are tested on common devices, they have not been optimized for this
            platform. Performance on Android devices has been found to be device specific.
        </p>

        <h2>On the horizon and beyond</h2>

        <p>
            We are actively working towards and raising funds to realize our full vision for next-generation PhET simulations. In the next phase of
            development, we aim to allow easy web-based translation of our HTML5 sims, as well as allowing offline access to these sims.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, our future goals go well beyond design and technology updates. In addition to adding new sims, our plans for the future include:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Enhanced integration with common educational products</li>
            <li>Customization support for educators and 3rd party users, including mixing screens from various sims, setting opening conditions, or
                limiting sim parameters
            </li>
            <li>Support for record and playback of student use</li>
            <li>Increased capabilities for data gathering, to support use in assessment</li>
            <li>Increased accessibility features</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Recommendations for Use on Tablets</h2>

        <p>
            <em>Landscape Orientation</em>: Our sims have been optimized for an aspect ratio that is best suited to a landscape orientation when using
            a tablet.
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>Slightly Tilted</em>: User visibility of the dynamic feedback within sims is important for learning. We suggest that users do not use
            sims with a tablet laid flat on a table, as this scenario tends to lead users to obscure much of the screen with their hand. We highly
            recommend using a tablet with a slight tilt, either held in the hand, or with some sort of stand.
        </p>

        <h2>Open Educational Resource</h2>

        <p>
            As always, our sims continue to be provided under a Creative Commons Attribution license.
        </p>

        <h2>Open Source</h2>

        <p>
            Our work in HTML5 has involved a tremendous coding effort, especially creating new software tools to conquer the challenges unique to
            creating applications as rich, interactive, and dynamic as PhET sims in a browser.
        </p>

        <p>
            PhET's libraries are available under the MIT license, and our sim-specific code is available under the GPLv3. You can view the source code
            for our sims and related libraries on Github at:

        <h2>Thanks for your support</h2>

        <p>
            New HTML5 sims will be released regularly, so please stay up to date through our website, newsletter, or social media channels.
        </p>

        <p>
            We hope you enjoy exploring the new features of our next-generation sims. Thank you for being a part of the PhET community!
