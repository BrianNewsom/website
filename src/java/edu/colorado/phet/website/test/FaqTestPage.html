                Why should I use this simulation with my students?
            </div>
            <div class="simFaqAnswer">
                Our studies show that using the simulation helps make complex circuit concepts and lab skills easier for students. To find
                out more, check out these articles: Assessing the effectiveness of computer simulation in an introductory undergraduate
                environment and Assessing the effectiveness of a computer simulation in conjunction with Tutorials In Introductory Physics

            </div>
            <div class="simFaqAnswer">
                Students sometimes have difficulty recognizing if the switch is completely closed or not.

                What's the underlying model being used?
            </div>
            <div class="simFaqAnswer">
                The short answer is, the model is computed using Modified Nodal Analysis. Capacitors and inductors are linearized at each
                time step and dynamic timestep subdivisions are used to balance accuracy and speed. <br/>If you're interested in more

                Why are there multiple versions of Circuit Construction Kit?
            </div>
            <div class="simFaqAnswer">
                The DC version of Circuit Construction Kit is the simplest. This is a good simulation to get your students started. The AC
                version includes AC voltage sources, capacitors and inductors. The "Virtual Lab" versions do not have the ammeter that can
                be moved onto components to determine the current. This feature was added at the request of teachers who use ammeters that
                must be incorporated into the circuit.

                Sure! Use the Pause button at the bottom of the simulation to pause the sim. Then select Play to when you're ready to keep
                going. You can also use the Step button to see what's happening in small time increments.

            <div class="simFaqAnswer">
                You sure can! Just select 'Options' in the upper right hand corner of the simulation, select 'Background Color', pick the
                color you prefer (white works well for printing) and select 'OK'.
                If you want to change it back to the original settings, follow the same instructions, but select 'Reset' instead of 'OK'.

                Why does my circuit look like it's on fire?
            </div>
            <div class="simFaqAnswer">
                Because it is! Fire denotes a short circuit, or a very high current.

            </div>
            <div class="simFaqAnswer">
                You probably have created a circuit with a very high current. When this happens, the blue electron dots cannot be shown to
                move fast enough. When this happens, the electrons appear to 'freeze' and the text "Animation speed limit reached!
                Simulation speed reduced to 75% normal!" is shown in red on the lower right hand side of the screen.

            <div class="simFaqAnswer">
                To open a saved configuration, download the file. To open a file, the Circuit Construction Kit simulation must be open.
                Press the 'LOAD' button, and load the file with the .cck extension. If the saved configuration file does not have the .cck
                extension, then in the FILE TYPES box, select 'ALL FILES'.

            <div class="simFaqAnswer">
                The lifelike option shows a cartoon-like version of all of the components. This is a great place to stay with younger
                students, or for introductory classes. The schematic option shows the components as you would see them drawn in schematic
                representations of circuits. This is great for more advanced students.

            <div class="simFaqAnswer">
                Sure! Measure the current and voltage values, and use Ohm's Law R = V/I to determine the wire resistance. Note, when you
                change wire resistivity, the amount of resistance will vary with the length of the wire.
