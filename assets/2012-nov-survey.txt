Dear Fellow Educators, Administrators, Education Resource Providers,

The PhET Interactive Simulations project (http://phet.colorado.edu) needs your help!

To help us secure future funding to advance our work and keep PhET free, and to make the site as useful as possible for YOU, we need to know more about how, where, and why you use PhET in your teaching, and how you see the simulations influencing your students' learning. We also want your input on future directions for the PhET project.

We are seeking very broad representation, so *please complete* our survey and *forward* this invitation to any educators you know. The survey will take ~15-20 minutes, and your answers automatically save as you progress.

If you are ...

Your participation is entirely voluntary, and your individual responses to this survey will be confidential. If you would like your institution to appear on a list or map of PhET users, you will have an opportunity to provide permission.

The survey results will be compiled to help improve PhET. Only aggregated results or anonymous statements will be used in any publications or reports, be disseminated on our website, or used in presentations to funders, educators, or researchers.

Thank you for your time and feedback!

Your PhET Team,
