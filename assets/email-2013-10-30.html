    <h2>Specialist in Educational Simulation Design and Use for the PhET Interactive Simulations project at University of Colorado Boulder</h2>
</p><p>
    The PhET Interactive Simulations Project (<a href="http://phet.colorado.edu" target="_blank">http://phet.colorado.edu</a>) at the University of Colorado Boulder has an opening for a full- or part-time Professional Research Assistant position with a focus on simulation design and testing as well as teacher professional development around simulation use. The PhET Team designs and develops interactive simulations (sims) for teaching and learning science and math, creates activities that couple with the sims, and makes all of these resources freely available to educators and students on the web. Research - at both K12 and college levels - is a major component of the PhET Project, and focuses on understanding aspects of design and use that lead to increases in student learning and student engagement.
</p><p>
    PhET is currently engaged in several initiatives: building and studying simulations for middle school math and science, advancing our teacher professional development resources and support system, branching into tablet and touch-compatible simulation design, and advancing the use of simulations in undergraduate chemistry.
</p><p>
    The successful applicant will join the vibrant and productive PhET team. The responsibilities will grow as the applicant becomes familiar with the project, and will include: 
</p><ol>
    <li>Redesigning (as part of a 3-5 person team) existing PhET simulations, incorporating new findings on effective sim design and adapting designs for use on touch-devices. (Software programming is NOT required. PhET has a team of in-house software developers). </li>
    <li>Designing new PhET simulations</li>
    <li>Conducting user-testing through interviews of students using simulations</li>
    <li>Supporting simulation design, development, and research efforts - e.g. analyzing data, supporting classroom research studies, searching for web resources, etc.</li>
    <li>Helping to liaison to and support the K12 community. </li>
    <li>Assisting with marketing and dissemination of PhET resources to teachers: develop and represent PhET in online teaching forums and resources; run exhibit booths at national and local conferences; assist with teacher workshops.</li> 
    <li>Responding to inquiries to PhET about science/math questions and new simulation ideas</li>
</ol><p>
    Part-time candidates must be able to work at least 20 hours per week.
</p><p>
    The successful candidate will work at the University of Colorado Boulder which is a national leader in STEM education with over 50 campus programs addressing STEM education and a new Center for Science Learning launched in 2012. The candidate will join the PhET Interactive Simulation project's growing team of 19 full and part-time faculty, researchers, teachers, software developers, and staff.
