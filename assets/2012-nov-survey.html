Dear Fellow Educators, Administrators, Education Resource Providers,<br>
<br>
The PhET Interactive Simulations project (<a href="http://phet.colorado.edu" target="_blank">http://phet.colorado.edu</a>) needs your help!<br>
<br>
To help us secure future funding to advance our work and keep PhET free, and to make the site as useful as possible for YOU, we need to know more about how, where, and why you use PhET in your teaching, and how you see the simulations influencing your students' learning. We also want your input on future directions for the PhET project.<br>
<br>
We are seeking very broad representation, so *please complete* our survey and *forward* this invitation to any educators you know. The survey will take ~15-20 minutes, and your answers automatically save as you progress.<br>
<br>
